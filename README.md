# Data Structure Course Labs

This repository contains the labs completed as part of the Data Structure course. Each lab focuses on implementing and understanding different data structures and their associated operations. The labs cover a range of topics including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and more. 

## Lab 1: Calculator
In this lab, you will implement a basic calculator that can perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator will take input expressions and evaluate them using appropriate data structures and algorithms.

## Lab 2: Operations on Array
This lab focuses on various operations that can be performed on arrays, including searching for an element, inserting elements, deleting elements, and sorting. You will explore different algorithms and techniques to efficiently manipulate arrays and understand their time and space complexities.

## Lab 3: Player Finder
In this lab, you will implement a player finder program that allows searching and retrieving player information based on various criteria. You will use appropriate data structures to store and organize the player data efficiently and implement algorithms for searching and retrieving players based on specified attributes.

## Lab 4: Linked List
This lab explores the concept of linked lists, both singly linked lists and doubly linked lists. You will implement the basic operations on linked lists, such as insertion, deletion, and traversal. Additionally, you will understand the differences between linked lists and arrays and analyze their advantages and disadvantages.

## Lab 5: Stack
In this lab, you will dive into the stack data structure and implement various stack operations, including push, pop, and peek. You will explore how stacks can be used in different scenarios, such as evaluating postfix expressions, checking balanced parentheses, and solving problems like tower of Hanoi.

## Lab 6: Queue
The focus of this lab is on the queue data structure. You will implement basic queue operations like enqueue and dequeue, and explore different variants of queues, such as circular queues and priority queues. Additionally, you will understand how queues can be applied in real-life scenarios, such as job scheduling and breadth-first search algorithms.

Feel free to explore each lab's folder to access the corresponding source code, implementation details, and any additional instructions provided for each assignment.

Please note that these labs are intended for educational purposes and serve as a hands-on approach to reinforce the concepts learned in the Data Structure course.

Enjoy your journey through the world of data structures!
